  - Functions and arrays
  - Database operations (CRUD operations)
  - Sessions and cookies
  - File inclusion and database connections
- **File Naming**: Numbered files for easy progression through concepts

### 🖼️ ImageUpload
A simple image upload system with database storage.
- **Files**: `index.php`, `image.php`, `dbconnect.php`, `img.sql`
- **Features**: File upload handling, database storage, image display
- **Database**: MySQL database with image metadata storage

### 🔐 SecureGate
A user authentication system with login/signup functionality.
- **Files**: `login.php`, `signup.php`, `index.php`, `logout.php`
- **Features**: User registration, login/logout, session management
- **Structure**: Organized with partials for modular code

### 📝 NoteNest
A note-taking application with modern UI.
- **Files**: `index.php`, `script.js`, `style.css`, `dbconnect.php`
- **Features**: CRUD operations for notes, responsive design
- **Technologies**: PHP backend, JavaScript frontend, CSS styling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL/MariaDB database server
- Web server (Apache/Nginx) or PHP built-in server

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd PHP
   ```

2. **Configure your web server**
   - Point your web server to this directory
   - Or use PHP's built-in server:
     ```bash
     php -S localhost:80
     ```

3. **Database Setup**
   - Import the SQL files provided in each project
   - Update database connection details in `dbconnect.php` files
   - Ensure your MySQL server is running

4. **Access Projects**
   - **ImageUpload**: `http://localhost/ImageUpload/`
   - **PracticePHP**: `http://localhost/PracticePHP/`
   - **SecureGate**: `http://localhost/SecureGate/`
   - **NoteNest**: `http://localhost/NoteNest/`

## 🔧 Configuration

### Database Connection
Most projects use a `dbconnect.php` file. Update these with your database credentials:

```php
<?php
$host = "localhost";
$username = "your_username";
$password = "your_password";
$database = "your_database";
?>
```

### File Permissions
Ensure the `uploads/` directory in ImageUpload has write permissions:
```bash
chmod 755 ImageUpload/uploads/
```

## 📖 Learning Path

### For Beginners
1. Start with **PracticePHP** - work through the numbered files sequentially
2. Move to **ImageUpload** to learn file handling
3. Explore **SecureGate** for authentication concepts
4. Study **NoteNest** for full-stack application development

### For Intermediate Developers
- Focus on **SecureGate** and **NoteNest** for advanced concepts
- Study the database interactions and session management
- Analyze the code structure and organization

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**: PHP 7.4+
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Additional**: Sessions, Cookies, File Uploads
